<h2>The Opening of a New Bookstore in Voula</h2>
<p>Being a residential area, Voula does not possess a great amount of restaurants, cafes or stores. People usually have to travel in order to provide themselves necessities, one of them being: books.</p>
<h3>Voula finally has its own bookstore again!</h3>
<p><b>Books</b> are truly essential to the development of children as well as a helpful guide to adults, as they improve our language skills, offer us knowledge, wisdom, inspiration, joy and entertainment, train the brain and give us important life lessons!</p>
<p>Considering how difficult it used to be to access any sort of book in Voula, people were delighted to find out that the old two-storey building has been transformed into a bookstore! The second floor is carefully decorated to look like a library so that it can be used by customers as a place to relax and read!</p>
<p>People say:</p>
<blockquote>Absolotely enchanted us with its beautiful atmosphere and wonderful books!</blockquote>
<p>The new store surely gained popularity as the only way to access as well as read books around town. It continues to grow every day, welcoming more and more enthralled readers!</p>
